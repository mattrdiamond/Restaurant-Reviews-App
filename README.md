# Project Overview

Dine Wise is a resturant reviews application that allows the user to filter restaurant reviews by location and/or cuisine. It also integrates the Mapbox API to show the restaurant location on an interactive map. Dine Wise uses a Service Worker to cache all of the siteâ€™s assets, so that any page that has visited by a user will be accessible offline.
